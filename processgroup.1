.TH PROCESSGROUP 1 "2025" "CSC 332 Project" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
processgroup \- spawns, manages, and safely terminates a group of child processes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B processgroup
[\-n NUM] 
[\-q] 
[\-r] 
[\-\-test]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The .B processgroup command creates a group of child processes, 
monitors them, and safely terminates them upon receiving a SIGINT (Ctrl+C). 
It is designed to demonstrate process creation, signal handling, and process cleanup using:
.BR fork (2),
.BR kill (2),
and
.BR waitpid (2).

By default, the program spawns 5 child processes. The parent remains active until
SIGINT is received, at which point all child processes are terminated and reaped
to prevent the creation of zombie processes.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-n NUM
Specifies the number of child processes to create.
NUM must be between 1 and 20.

.TP
.B \-q
Quiet mode.  
Child processes run silently without printing "Running..." messages.

.TP
.B \-r
Random mode.  
Each child process sleeps for a random interval between 1 and 3 seconds before
printing its "Running..." message (unless quiet mode is enabled).

.TP
.B \-\-test
Displays a suite of built-in test cases showing expected program behavior.
No child processes are spawned in this mode.

.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.B SIGINT
When SIGINT (Ctrl+C) is received, the program stops its main loop and begins a
graceful shutdown sequence:
.IP \(bu 2
All child processes are sent SIGTERM.
.IP \(bu 2
The parent waits for each child using
.BR waitpid (2).
.IP \(bu 2
No zombie processes remain.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The program returns:
.TP
.B 0
Normal termination.
.TP
.B 1
Invalid usage or argument error.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Create 5 children (default):
.IP
.nf
processgroup
.fi

.TP
Create 10 children:
.IP
.nf
processgroup -n 10
.fi

.TP
Run quietly:
.IP
.nf
processgroup -q
.fi

.TP
Spawn 6 children with random timing:
.IP
.nf
processgroup -n 6 -r
.fi

.TP
Run test suite:
.IP
.nf
processgroup --test
.fi
