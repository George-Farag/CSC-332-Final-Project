.TH MEMVIEW 1 "November 2025" "memview 1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
memview \- display a file's memory mapping, hex dump, and shared memory status

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B memview
.I filename

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B memview
utility displays three major types of information:

.TP
1. A hex + ASCII dump of the specified file.
This shows the raw bytes of the file, grouped by 16 bytes per line, along with their printable character equivalents.

.TP
2. The process's virtual memory map.
This is obtained from
.I /proc/self/maps
and displays details about the program's memory layout including:
.br
\- the executable segments
.br
\- the heap
.br
\- the stack
.br
\- shared libraries
.br
\- memory mappings created by mmap()

.TP
3. System V shared memory segments.
This data is retrieved using the system command
.B ipcs -m.
It shows all currently allocated shared memory blocks on the system and lists:
.br
\- keys
.br
\- segment IDs
.br
\- owners
.br
\- permissions
.br
\- size
.br
\- attached processes

.PP
The file is mapped into memory using
.BR mmap (2)
in read-only mode. The resulting address space is scanned and dumped in hexadecimal format.

If the file cannot be opened, is empty, or cannot be memory-mapped, the program prints an error message and exits.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I filename
The path to the file to view. Must be readable and non-empty.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Success.
.TP
.B 1
Usage error, missing file argument, unreadable file, or mmap failure.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /proc/self/maps
Virtual memory layout of the running process.
.TP
.I /dev/urandom
Frequently used as input for random binary test files.
.TP
.I /dev/null
Special device that appears empty and triggers an "empty file" error.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
View a normal text file:
.nf
    memview notes.txt
.fi

.TP
View a symbolic link:
.nf
    memview link_to_file
.fi

.TP
View a large random binary:
.nf
    dd if=/dev/urandom of=data.bin bs=1024 count=32
    memview data.bin
.fi

.TP
Check shared memory status:
.nf
    ipcmk -M 4096
    memview test.txt
.fi
